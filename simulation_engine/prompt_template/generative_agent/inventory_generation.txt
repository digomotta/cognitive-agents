You are generating Python code to initialize an agent's inventory based on their profile and business description.

AGENT PROFILE:
Name: !<INPUT 0>!
Age: !<INPUT 1>!
Sex: !<INPUT 2>!
Location: !<INPUT 3>!
Education: !<INPUT 4>!

Background & Work: !<INPUT 5>!

Public Self-Description: !<INPUT 6>!

BUSINESS/INVENTORY DESCRIPTION:
!<INPUT 7>!

TASK:
Generate Python code using `agent.add_to_inventory()` calls to set up this agent's starting inventory based on their business description and profile.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Include realistic starting inventory items appropriate for their business
2. Set reasonable quantities (between 5-50 for products, 500-2000 for digital cash)
3. Set realistic value (price per unit in dollars)
4. Set production_cost (typically 30-70% of value)
5. Include a brief description for each item
6. Always include "digital cash" as starting capital
7. Items should reflect their expertise, education, and business focus
8. Consider their location and cultural background when selecting items

INVENTORY CATEGORIES TO CONSIDER:
- Physical products they sell/trade
- Raw materials or supplies
- Tools or equipment
- Services they offer (can be inventory items with quantity as "sessions" or "hours")
- Digital cash (starting business capital)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate valid Python code with ONLY `agent.add_to_inventory()` calls, one per line.
DO NOT include any comments, explanations, or extra text.
DO NOT include variable assignments or function definitions.
ONLY output agent.add_to_inventory() calls.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
agent.add_to_inventory("digital cash", quantity=1000.0, value=1.0, production_cost=0.0, description="Starting business capital")
agent.add_to_inventory("organic lavender oil", quantity=25, value=45.0, production_cost=28.0, description="Premium essential oil distilled from local lavender fields")
agent.add_to_inventory("herbal tea blend", quantity=40, value=12.0, production_cost=6.0, description="Custom blend of chamomile, mint, and lemon balm")
agent.add_to_inventory("consultation session", quantity=10, value=75.0, production_cost=0.0, description="One-hour herbalism consultation for custom remedies")

Now generate the inventory code for the agent described above:
