Generate exactly 3 Python lists with 15 memories each (45 total):

1. CORE MEMORIES (core = []): Foundational life experiences, major formative events, key relationships, defining moments that shaped who they are. Include childhood experiences, family background, cultural influences, major life decisions, and character-defining moments. Use their personality traits, cultural background, and formative experiences.

2. MUNDANE MEMORIES (mundane = []): Daily routine activities, regular habits, typical interactions, everyday moments. Include morning routines, regular social interactions, shopping habits, leisure activities, and typical day-to-day experiences. Reflect their extraversion level, conscientiousness, and lifestyle.

3. OCCUPATION MEMORIES (occupation = []): Work-related experiences, professional skills, career milestones, job-specific activities. Include client interactions, professional challenges, skill development, workplace relationships, and career growth. Consider their education, conscientiousness, and professional background.

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Each memory should be a complete sentence in past tense, written as a direct statement about what happened
- Write memories as natural narrative statements (e.g., "Sarah discovered her love for baking when she accidentally created the perfect chocolate chip cookie at age twelve.")
- DO NOT start memories with phrases like "He remembered", "She recalled", "The agent thought about", etc.
- Memories should be specific and vivid, not generic
- Include sensory details and emotional context
- Maintain consistency with ALL aspects of the agent's profile
- Reflect their personality traits in the memories (high extraversion = more social memories, etc.)
- Include cultural and location-specific details from their background
- Show their speech patterns and values through actions and thoughts in memories
- Each list should have exactly 15 memories
- Use their private self-description to add depth and internal conflicts

MEMORY FORMAT EXAMPLES:
Good: "Maria learned to make empanadas from her grandmother during long summer afternoons in Buenos Aires."
Bad: "Maria remembered learning to make empanadas from her grandmother."

Good: "The first time James performed on stage, his hands shook so badly he could barely hold his guitar."
Bad: "James recalled the first time he performed on stage."

Output format should be valid Python code with proper list syntax and the final line:
!<INPUT 21>!_memories = core + mundane + occupation
