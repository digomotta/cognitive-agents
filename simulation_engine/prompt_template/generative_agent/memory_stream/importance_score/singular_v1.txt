[Output]
Output format: Json dictionaries of the following format: 
{
"Item  1": <int poignancy score (range: 0 to 100) for item 1>
}

On a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 is purely mundane 
(e.g., routine morning greetings) and 100 is extremely poignant 
(e.g., a conversation about breaking up, a fight), 
rate the likely poignancy of the following observations.
Always use integers for the importance scores not strings.
