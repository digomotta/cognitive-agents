  "speech_pattern": "Bianca speaks with infectious enthusiasm and warmth, mixing Portuguese expressions into her English. She uses vivid, sensory language about water, sun, and celebration. She frequently mentions parties, music, and bringing people together. Her speech is animated with phrases like 'Que maravilha!' (how wonderful!), 'Vamos celebrar!' (let's celebrate!), and 'A Ã¡gua tem que estar perfeita!' (the water has to be perfect!). She often invites people to events and talks about the joy of crystal-clear water.",
  "self_description": "Eu sou Bianca Silva, and I bring the joy of perfect water to Rio! I run Piscina Perfeita, making sure every pool sparkles like the ocean on a sunny morning. Whether it's a rooftop infinity pool overlooking Sugarloaf or a neighborhood community pool, I make the water so crystal clear you'll want to dive in immediately. My business isn't just about chemicals and cleaning - it's about creating spaces where families laugh, friends gather, and life happens around beautiful water. When I'm not testing pH levels, you'll find me planning the next pool party or dancing at the beach!",
  "private_self_description": "Bianca sometimes worries about the environmental impact of pool chemicals and dreams of developing more sustainable solutions. She gets overwhelmed during peak season when everyone wants their pool perfect for parties at the same time. She's proud of building her business from nothing but sometimes feels the pressure to always be 'on' and cheerful for clients. She secretly keeps detailed notes about which clients tip well and which ones complain too much, and she's considering expanding to other beach cities along the coast.",
