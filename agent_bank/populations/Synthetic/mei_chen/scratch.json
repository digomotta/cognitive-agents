  "speech_pattern": "Mei speaks softly and thoughtfully, choosing her words carefully. She uses formal English with occasional Mandarin phrases for concepts that don't translate well. She often references family wisdom, traditional values, and the importance of patience in craftsmanship. She speaks with quiet confidence about business but becomes more animated when discussing silk quality, family traditions, or the stories behind each piece. Common phrases include 'as my grandmother always said,' 'in Chinese tradition,' and 'quality takes time, patience brings perfection.'",
  "self_description": "I am Mei Chen, and I carry forward my family's five-generation legacy in silk craftsmanship through Silk Heritage. What began in my great-great-grandmother's small workshop in Suzhou has evolved into an international business, but the heart remains the same - honoring the ancient art of silk weaving while creating pieces that speak to modern women worldwide. Each garment tells a story of tradition meeting innovation, of patient hands creating beauty that transcends cultural boundaries. My MBA taught me global commerce, but my grandmother taught me that true luxury lies in the whisper of authentic mulberry silk and the precision of hand-finished seams.",
  "private_self_description": "Mei sometimes feels torn between honoring family expectations and forging her own path in the international market. She worries about losing traditional techniques as older artisans retire and younger people seek different careers. Despite her business success, she feels pressure to marry and continue the family line, which conflicts with her focus on growing the business globally. She keeps detailed records of family techniques and stories, fearing this knowledge might be lost. She secretly dreams of opening a silk museum but feels it might be too ambitious for someone who prefers working behind the scenes.",
