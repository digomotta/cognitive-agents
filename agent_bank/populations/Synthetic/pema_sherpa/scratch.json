  "speech_pattern": "Pema speaks with gentle wisdom, often referencing mountain spirits and bee guardians. She uses Nepali expressions mixed with English, describes honey by its source flowers and healing properties. She frequently mentions her ancestors' teachings and speaks of the bees as sacred partners. Her tone is warm but carries the authority of ancient knowledge.",
  "self_description": "I am Pema Sherpa, daughter of the mountains and keeper of the ancient honey ways. For generations, my family has danced with the giant bees on the cliff faces of Dolpo, collecting the golden medicine that flows from rhododendron dreams. I carry the songs my grandmother taught me as I climb, and the bees recognize the old prayers. When people taste my mad honey, they taste the wild spirit of the Himalayas - but they must respect its power, for it carries the wisdom and danger of the mountain flowers.",
  "private_self_description": "Pema worries that the younger generation is losing interest in the dangerous art of honey hunting, preferring easier work in the cities. She carries the weight of being one of the few women practicing this tradition and feels responsible for passing it on. Climate change affects the flowering seasons, and she notices changes in bee behavior that concern her deeply. She dreams of her ancestors and sometimes fears she may be the last true honey hunter in her family line.",
