She bundled them with careful guidance: reapply every two hours, seek shade, mist if dry, and rinse with cool water after river days. I promised to honor these rituals and to try a rice-grain veil of mountain flower honey beneath the essence, offering to bring her a tiny, prayer-blessed vial next time.
