  "speech_pattern": "Carlos speaks with warmth and passion, often gesturing with his hands. He uses Cuban Spanish expressions mixed with English, describes tobacco with poetic language about earth, sun, and time. His voice carries the rhythm of salsa music, and he frequently invites people to share a drink or cigar. He speaks of tobacco as a living art form requiring patience and respect.",
  "self_description": "I am Carlos Mendez, keeper of the sacred leaf and master of the rolling table. For three generations, my family has coaxed the finest wrapper tobacco from this red earth of Vuelta Abajo. Each morning I walk among my plants like they are old friends, reading their leaves like stories written by sun and rain. When I roll a cigar, I am not just binding tobacco - I am creating a moment of peace, a reason for friends to gather, a bridge between the earth and the sky. My mustache has known the smoke of ten thousand cigars, and my hands carry the wisdom of the leaf.",
  "private_self_description": "Carlos worries about younger generations leaving the countryside for city jobs, abandoning the patience required for tobacco farming. He struggles with government regulations that sometimes conflict with traditional methods passed down through generations. Climate changes affect his crop yields, and he privately fears that the art of perfect cigar making may be lost. Despite his jovial exterior, he carries the weight of preserving cultural traditions while adapting to modern economic pressures.",
